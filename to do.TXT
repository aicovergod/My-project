- Fix tree stumps, currently when a tree is chopped, it spawns a stump -1 (which is what i want)
But it also moves the collision -1, so my player is forcefully moved because the collision is moving my player when the stump spawns at -1
I dont want the collision to move, i want the collision to stay in its initial location, upon stump generation
