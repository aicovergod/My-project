  content: "Beneath the sky where violets bloom, A humble town defies the gloom.
    Stone and timber, hearths that glow, Guard the secrets all folk know.  The river
    hums its silver song, Guiding traders swift along. Fields of grain and orchards
    sweet, Whisper welcome to all who meet.  By candle\u2019s light, the tales are
    told, Of goblin caves and miners bold. Of oaken woods where spirits hide, And
    magic roots that twist inside.  Though storms may howl and shadows creep, Violetstown
    will never sleep. For hearts are strong, and bonds are true, Its blossoms bloom
    in every hue."
