/// You are generating a new quest for my existing Unity 2D RuneScape-inspired game.
/// I already have a working Quest System, Dialogue System, Quest UI, and QuestManager.
/// Use those systems and generate all the code + ScriptableObjects needed for this quest.
///
/// ----------------------
/// QUEST DETAILS
/// ----------------------
/// Quest ID: [UNIQUE_ID]
/// Title: [QUEST_NAME]
/// NPC: [NPC_NAME] (NPC that starts/ends the quest)
/// Location: [TOWN/AREA]
///
/// Objectives (steps):
/// 1. [Describe step 1 clearly, e.g. "Chop 10 oak logs"]
/// 2. [Step 2...]
/// 3. [Final step...]
///
/// Rewards:
/// - [XP rewards]
/// - [Item rewards]
/// - [Coins]
///
/// Dialogue Flow for [NPC_NAME]:
/// - Before quest: "[Text shown before accepting]"
///   - Options: Accept -> StartQuest([UNIQUE_ID]) / Decline -> End dialogue
/// - In progress: "[Hint text while quest is ongoing]"
/// - Ready to complete: "[Text when requirements are done]" -> CompleteQuest([UNIQUE_ID])
/// - After completion: "[Generic post-quest text]"
///
/// ----------------------
/// WHAT TO GENERATE
/// ----------------------
/// 1. A QuestDefinition ScriptableObject with QuestID, Title, Description, Steps, and Rewards.
/// 2. A DialogueData ScriptableObject for [NPC_NAME] with dialogue lines that hook into the quest.
/// 3. Any required sample code for triggers (e.g. item collection, monster kill counts).
///
/// ----------------------
/// REQUIREMENTS
/// ----------------------
/// - Use my existing QuestManager & DialogueManager (assume they exist).
/// - Quest progress must be text-based only (no clickable steps).
/// - Dialogue system must use DialogueData ScriptableObjects.
/// - Code should be clean, modular, and commented.
/// - Generate everything needed so I can drop the quest into Unity and it works.
